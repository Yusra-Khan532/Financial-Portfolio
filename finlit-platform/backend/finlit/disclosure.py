"""Fund facts from AMFI's own published files: fund size (average AUM), expense ratio (TER, Regular and Direct plan) and launch date,
for mutual funds and ETFs alike (an ETF is an AMFI scheme too). Read by finlit/mf.py and finlit/etf.py; written by the
`refresh-facts` worker command.

Sources (each checked by hand against the live site, October 2026, and recorded in tests/fixtures/disclosure):

Rules: each step stands alone (one failing leaves the others and the stored figures as they were); an answer that fails its checks is refused
and nothing is stored from it; a quarter of AUM figures replaces the previous quarter whole, never mixed. A fact with no verified free source
says so instead of showing a guess. Information only, never advice.
