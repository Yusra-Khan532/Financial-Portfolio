"""ETFs: list, detail and compare for exchange-traded funds listed on NSE.

Where each figure comes from (nothing else is shown):
  * the list of ETFs and their ISINs     Upstox instrument list (NSE_EQ, instrument type EQ, ISIN starting INF)
  * prices and history                   Upstox quotes and daily candles (10 years at most, one call per ETF)
  * NAV, registered name, fund house     AMFI's NAVAll.txt, matched by ISIN only
Upstox does NOT publish AUM, expense ratio, tracking error, holdings, benchmark, launch date or fund manager, so the pages say so instead of
showing a made-up or empty number. Every figure derived from prices is "price return": dividends are not included.

Hot and cold (migration 038): the 100 ETFs with the highest traded value (average of close x volume over 20 sessions, from Upstox candles) are
"hot": their 10-year packed history stays in Postgres and their ready-made list rows are in the etf_hot table and in Redis. Every other ETF is
"cold": its narrow row (price, 1-day / 1-year / 5-year and the other figures, computed every night from the full 10 years) still covers
lists, sorts and filters, but its candle history is fetched from Upstox when somebody opens it and cached in Redis for 14 days.

Honesty rules the code enforces:
  * a price series with a day-to-day move beyond +/-40% (an unadjusted split, a face-value change, a bad tick) or with repeated dates is
    treated as unreliable BEFORE the last such day: figures that would need earlier prices are withheld with the reason, never computed;
  * a return needs a price on or before the look-back date (within 10 days); a young ETF shows "Listed less than N years";
  * the nightly job only adds and updates rows. A short or empty provider answer, an expired token or a shrunken instrument list leaves the
    stored rows exactly as they were.
