"""The declarative list of every background job (docs/JOBS.md, "How to add a job").

!!! THE FOUNDER'S RULE (7 Nov 2026), above every other line in this package: background jobs NEVER stop. Every scheduled job runs every day and
!!! completes every day. Never switch off, pause, skip, disable or weaken a job, its schedule, its time limit or its retries. See JOBS_RULE below.

One Job per thing the supervisor runs. Nothing here runs anything: due.py decides WHEN from this data, supervisor.py runs it.
Changing a schedule, an SLA or a priority is a one-line edit here plus a test; there is no scheduling logic to touch.

Fields in plain words
  cls            bulk: strictly one (BULK_CONCURRENCY) at a time, niced, first by priority. light: up to LIGHT_CONCURRENCY beside the bulk job.
                 audit: slow checks that are never urgent (coverage, integrity): their own lane, one (AUDIT_CONCURRENCY) at a time, niced, so a 15-minute audit can never hold a light slot that results or calendars are waiting for.
                 ondemand: its own always-on process kept by deploy/scheduler.sh (visible in the status, never started by the supervisor).
  windows        quiet windows in which the job runs when its last success is at least min_age_h old (not_before: not earlier than that IST time).
  interval_min   also run when the last success is this old (inside active_hours / market hours when those are set).
  daily_at       also run once a day from this IST time (until it has succeeded since).
  day_rule       the job's windows / daily_at / interval apply only on days where this is true (Saturday, weekdays ...); never starves: the SLA still applies.
  sla            the freshness promise. 'hours': a success within N hours. 'active': N hours, counted only from 08:00 IST (results). 'session': a success
                 after the latest trading day's data is final (18:30 IST), and overdue N hours after that. 'none': no promise (visitor-driven jobs).
  probe          a cheap question ("is there anything to do?") asked at most every 5 minutes; the job runs when the answer is yes (unknown = run on the clock).
  prerequisites  jobs that must not be running or due right now (a failing prerequisite never blocks for long: it is held or in backoff).
  resumable      the job continues where it stopped, so reaching max_runtime is a polite yield (retried in 2 minutes), not a failure.
