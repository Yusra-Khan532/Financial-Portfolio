"""Mutual funds: list, detail and compare, built on AMFI's own public files (no key, no paid service).

Sources, in order of preference
  1. https://portal.amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt  every scheme AMFI publishes (about 14,400, stopped ones included) with its latest NAV and date.
     The section header lines give the category ("Open Ended Schemes(Equity Scheme - Mid Cap Fund)"), a line below names the fund house.
  2. https://portal.amfiindia.com/DownloadNAVHistoryReport_Po.aspx?mf=<id>&frmdt=DD-Mon-YYYY&todt=DD-Mon-YYYY  the official daily NAV history.
     It can only be asked for a whole fund house (the `scheme` parameter is ignored), about 13 MB and 9 s a year for a house of 400 schemes, so history is
     loaded one fund house at a time by `backfill`. The ids are the ones in the fund-house dropdown of amfiindia.com/net-asset-value/nav-history (AMC_IDS).
  3. https://api.mfapi.in/mf/<code>  a third-party mirror of the same AMFI data. Used only on demand, for a Growth scheme whose AMFI history has not been
     loaded (for example fund houses missing from AMFI's dropdown), and only after its newest NAV is checked against AMFI's NAVAll. The page always says so.

What is stored (the free database is small): every scheme with its latest NAV, its previous NAV (the 1 day change), its 1, 3 and 5 year returns, its
SIP returns (worked out from about 60 month-end NAVs a scheme, table mf_monthly), fund size, expense ratio and checklist, so the list is a plain query. The daily NAV series (packed at ~3 bytes a point, with volatility, drawdown and the other periods) is kept only for the
100 "hot" schemes, answered from the mf_hot table / Redis in milliseconds; any other Growth scheme's series is fetched when somebody opens it and cached in
Redis for a few days. The 1 year and 5 year figures of the others are kept current each night from AMFI's industry-wide history for just the two start dates. IDCW / dividend options are listed
with their own NAV but no returns: a payout lowers the NAV, so NAV-to-NAV change would understate what an investor earned.

Not here, on purpose: AUM, expense ratio, holdings, sector split, benchmark, manager, launch date, risk-o-meter. AMFI does not put them in the NAV files and
nothing is shown that cannot be checked against a source. This is information only, never advice.
