"""Fund Compare: two mutual funds of one category head to head over 1, 3, 5 or 10 years, on four questions (returns, risk, consistency,
costs), each fund also measured against its category's average. Built on the same AMFI NAV data as finlit/mf.py; this is information only,
never advice.

Where the numbers come from
  NAV series        1Y / 3Y / 5Y: mf.load_series (AMFI's own stored history for the hot schemes, else the checked mirror; about five years).
                    10Y: the full history of the third-party mirror of AMFI data (api.mfapi.in), used only when its NAV for AMFI's latest (or the
                    previous) NAV date agrees with AMFI's NAVAll. AMFI's own history is stored for five years only, so 10Y always says so.
  Category average  an equal-weighted index of the category's active Growth options on the same plan (Direct by default), one per fund, at most
                    CAT_MAX of them (the largest by AUM when there are more): each weekday the index moves by the average of the members' NAV changes
                    that day. A fund joins on its first NAV day. Funds that closed or merged are not in AMFI's current list, so they are missing from
                    the average (it can flatter the category a little); the page says so. Worked out once per category, plan and NAV date and kept
                    in mf_cat_avg (migration 048), because it needs up to CAT_MAX NAV histories.
  Facts             finlit.disclosure.get_facts: expense ratio (TER), AUM, exit load, benchmark name, managers, risk-o-meter, each with its own date
                    and source, or the reason it is missing.

Not here, on purpose: alpha against the benchmark index. The index levels this site can load (finlit/indices.py, a paid provider) are price
indices without dividends and go back five years only, while a fund's NAV keeps its dividends; the comparison would flatter every fund. The
excess return shown is against the category average, and is labelled that way.
