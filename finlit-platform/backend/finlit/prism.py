"""FinLit Prism: the Gold plan's advanced financial-health rating (docs/prism/CONTRACT.md is the binding description).

    GET  /api/prism/status                                        is Prism connected? Public.
    GET  /api/prism/reports/latest?symbol=TCS&statement=...       the newest stored report for a company, without calculating;
                                                                  add &view=summary for the small card the stock page shows
    POST /api/prism/reports  {"symbol", "statement", "refresh"}   calculate, or reuse a stored report under 6 hours old
    GET  /api/prism/scores?symbols=TCS,INFY,...                   Gold only: the stored final, four category scores and short/long technical scores
                                                                  of up to 40 companies at once (the search palette); nothing is calculated
    GET  /api/prism/reports/{id}/pdf                              the PDF of exactly that calculation, while its snapshot lives (30 minutes)

The model runs in the site backend (site-api/backend, POST /api/premium-reports). Those routes are for administrators only, so this module
is the members' door: it checks the plan here (Gold, administrators, and the showcase companies for everyone), then calls the site backend
with a five-minute administrator token signed with the shared CMS_JWT_SECRET. That token never leaves this server.

A calculation used to take one to two minutes (some 250 provider calls, made a few at a time). It now makes the model's real requests together
and keeps what it learned, so a company takes about 5 to 15 seconds the first time and under a second the next (see "Speed" below), and:
  * the reader view of the newest report per company and statement basis is kept in Postgres (prism_reports) and reused for 6 hours;
  * the full signed snapshot, which the PDF renderer needs and the browser never sees, is kept in Redis for its 30 minutes, with the token
    subject it was signed for (the site backend renders the PDF only for that same subject);
  * each member may calculate 20 reports a day (by the Indian date; administrators are not limited; visitors, who may only open the
    showcase companies, are counted by address), at most 2 calculations run at once in a process, and a Redis lock makes a second request
    for the same company wait for the first one's answer instead of calculating it again.

Speed (nothing here changes a number; the model and the data it is fed are the same):
  * the model inputs of a company (statements, prices, ratios, ownership filings, industry list) are kept in Postgres (prism_inputs) for 24
    hours, packed; a repeat calculation (a recalculation after the 6 hours, say) then needs no provider call. "Recalculate" ignores them;
  * the one price-ratio row per industry peer that a median used is kept in Redis for 4 days, shared by every company of that industry;
  * a company opened with no rating starts calculating in the background (`background: true`), the page polls GET /api/prism/jobs and shows
    the rating when it is ready; the nightly pre-calculation covers every company with a full report and yields to a member who is waiting.

The rating describes a company's financial health from its filings and prices. It is not a recommendation.
