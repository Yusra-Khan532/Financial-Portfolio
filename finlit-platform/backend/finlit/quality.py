"""Data quality gate. Every snapshot is checked before it is published.

- critical: the data is very likely wrong (units, parsing, identities broken). The worker refuses to
  publish and keeps serving the last good snapshot, so users never see a broken page.
- warning:  publishable, but the page shows a "data note" and the issue is logged for review.
- The accounting identities below hold exactly on real FinEdge data (RELIANCE FY26: assets 1,165,809 =
  equity 566,235 + liabilities 599,574; price × shares = market cap within 0.01%), so they make good
  tripwires for unit and parsing bugs like the ones on the current site.
