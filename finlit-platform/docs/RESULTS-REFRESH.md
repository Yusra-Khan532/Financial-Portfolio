# Results refresh: how the latest results reach the site

## The pipeline
1. `refresh-calendars` asks the provider (FinEdge `/results-calendar`, 100 days back to 120 ahead) for board-meeting dates and stores them as `result` rows in `feed_items` (source "FinEdge results calendar"). Exchange filings that say "financial results" are stored as `result` rows too, whenever a company is loaded.
2. A company whose results date has passed (or that has a results filing) in the last 4 days is "declared". The Results pages list it at once, with "figures loading" until its numbers are in.
3. `refresh-results` rebuilds the full report of declared companies the site holds in full (provider calls for the whole bundle). `refresh-results-light` fetches only the quarterly profit and loss for the other declared companies and stores it in `quarter_light`.
4. Retry rule: a company the provider has no figures for is asked again at every run for two days after its declaration, then every 3 hours (day 3), then every 5 hours (day 4), then dropped. A run stops after 10 provider failures in a row.

## Schedule (IST, `deploy/scheduler.sh`, started by `deploy/render-start.sh` inside the app container)
- Every hour from 08:05 to 23:59, every day including weekends: `refresh-calendars` at :05, `refresh-results` at :20 and :50, `refresh-results-light` at :35. They no longer wait for a visitor (set `RESULTS_NEED_VISITOR=1` to bring that rule back).
- Also in the 06:45, 15:50 (weekdays), 19:10, 21:10 and 23:30 windows.
- A job that is skipped (admin switch "Heavy data loads" paused, previous run still going, low memory) leaves a one-line reason, shown below as `lastSkipped`. Logs: `/tmp/scheduler.log` and `/tmp/job-<name>.log` inside the app container.

## Check it from a browser (no SSH)
- `https://<your site>/api/results/status` shows `todayIST`, `newestResultInDb`, `newestFilingInDb`, `upcomingCount`, `lastRun.calendars|results|resultsLight` (`at` is UTC, `status`, `counts`, `newestResultDate`, `error`/`errors`/`why` when something went wrong) and `lastSkipped`.
- `/api/mf/status` lists the same runs as `run:refresh-calendars`, `run:refresh-results`, `run:refresh-results-light`.
- The Results calendar page shows "Updated <time> IST" and an amber note on a weekday in results season when the newest result is more than 2 days old.
- On the Latest results page each company without figures says whether it declared today (normal lag) or earlier (still loading, we are retrying), when we last asked and the newest quarter the provider holds for it.

How to read it:
- `lastRun.calendars.status` is `failed` with `error: ... HTTP 4xx/5xx`: the provider call fails (key, plan or outage). `error: the provider sent no rows` or `none with a symbol and a readable date (keys: ...)`: the provider's answer has another shape than the code reads; the keys are listed.
- `lastRun.*.at` is old or null, and `lastSkipped` has a reason: the scheduler is not running the job (read the reason).
- Both are missing: the scheduler is not running (the app container restarted without `scheduler.sh`, or the box is down).
- Jobs run fine but a company stays "still loading" and its note says "its newest is Jun 2026": the provider has not published the quarter. Nothing on our side can fix that; the page keeps asking. If it persists for many companies for more than a day, tell the provider.
- Jobs run, `results.counts.failed` is high and `why` says `rejected`: our data-quality gate refused the new report; see the admin Data health tab.

## Force a refresh now (run on the server)
```
cd /opt/finlit && docker compose --env-file .env.aws -f src/finlit-platform/deploy/aws/docker-compose.aws.yml exec -T app python -m finlit.worker refresh-calendars
cd /opt/finlit && docker compose --env-file .env.aws -f src/finlit-platform/deploy/aws/docker-compose.aws.yml exec -T app python -m finlit.worker refresh-results
cd /opt/finlit && docker compose --env-file .env.aws -f src/finlit-platform/deploy/aws/docker-compose.aws.yml exec -T app python -m finlit.worker refresh-results-light
```
Run them in that order. `refresh-results` and `refresh-results-light` skip a company they asked within the last 50 minutes (longer for companies declared 2 or more days ago), so a second run straight after the first only asks the companies not yet asked.

## Known limits
- Declaration dates have a day, not a time, so "declared today" is the nearest we can get to "declared a few hours ago".
- Whether the provider's quarterly endpoint lags cannot be seen from the code: `providerLatest` on a company (shown on the Latest results page) is the proof.
