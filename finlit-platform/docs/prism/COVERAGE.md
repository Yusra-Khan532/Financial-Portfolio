# Upstream coverage ledger: Yusra-Khan532/financial-portfolio -> FinLit

Every file tracked in the upstream repository (`git ls-files` at upstream HEAD **6ed9d2a**, 276 files) and where it is in FinLit. Upstream `backend/` = FinLit `site-api/backend/`; merge base for the first three-way merge = upstream **67aab4f** (commit 1346489 here); the second (26 Oct) merged b112ba1..6ed9d2a with base b112ba1. Generated and checked on 2026-10-26 (first merge 2026-10-25).

## Totals

| Status | Files | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `merged-identical` | 68 | a byte-identical copy exists in FinLit (checked with `cmp`) |
| `merged-3way` | 11 | merged with FinLit's own changes. Six (section 2): every upstream and every FinLit line proven present. Five premium files (premium_data, premium_completeness, premium_service, premium_benchmarks, premium_provider): FinLit additions on top of the verbatim import, listed under "Deliberate deviations" in section 2 (a few upstream lines are changed, not only added) |
| `ported` | 17 | rewritten for the FinLit TypeScript site; rewritten for the FinLit TypeScript site (the FinLit file is given; deliberate deviations are marked) |

## Features in upstream that FinLit does not have (excluding the premium model)

For the user to decide. None of these is needed by FinLit Prism.

| Feature | Upstream file(s) | What it does / FinLit state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CMS: edit an existing post | BlogAdminEditPage, ContentEditor | FinLit's Admin can only create a draft, publish/unpublish and delete; the site backend already supports `PUT /api/content/admin/items/{id}` with every field. |
| CMS: PDF / spreadsheet / image posts | ContentEditor | Upload a resource file (`POST /api/content/admin/upload`, 15 MB) as a Report, Data or Visual post. FinLit's blog can display such posts but its Admin cannot create them. |
| CMS: cover images | ContentEditor, blog/CoverImage | Upload a cover or give an https URL. FinLit shows covers but cannot set one. |
| CMS: rich-text editor | RichTextEditor (tiptap) | Bold, italic, underline, lists, quotes, https links and inline images. FinLit uses a plain textarea. |
| CMS: draft preview | BlogAdminPreviewPage | See a draft as readers will before publishing. |
| CMS: search and filter the content list | BlogAdminPage | Filter by status/type and search titles. |
| Portfolio statement upload | BlogAdminPage | Administrator uploads a new broker statement PDF (`POST /api/portfolio/admin/upload`) to refresh the public /portfolio report. FinLit's site backend supports it (and keeps it in MongoDB) but there is no button. |
| Bank asset quality | StockFundamentalsAdminPage | GNPA %, NNPA % and CET1 % for banks (site backend already returns `bankAssetQuality`). |
| Data quality flags | StockFundamentalsAdminPage | Shows where FinEdge and a fallback provider disagree (`dataQuality` in the fundamentals payload). |
| Dev metrics | StockFundamentalsAdminPage | Fetch timing and payload mix of the fundamentals request (administrator diagnostics). |
| Sector / industry company browser | CompanyBrowser, companyClassifications.json | Browse FinEdge companies by sector or industry. The research API already proxies `/api/premium/fundamentals/browse`; no FinLit page uses it. |
| P&L "Growth %" view (YoY / QoQ) | IncomeGrowthView, fundamentalGrowth | Toggle on the fundamentals P&L chart showing revenue, net profit and EPS growth, with the reason when a value cannot be computed. Added upstream since 67aab4f; not part of the model. |
| Key-factor panels | StockFundamentalsAdminPage | Stock DNA, Valuation / Quality / Technicals key factors and Financial Snapshot panels built from FinEdge highlights (FinLit has its own score pillars and valuation sections instead). |
| Home page sections | Home, Performance, Process, Philosophy, Testimonial | Portfolio performance, the 7-step process, philosophy and the client testimonial on the home page. The copy is already in `frontend/src/content/site.ts` but is not rendered. |
| Markets / Commodities dashboards: parity check | MarketsPage, CommodityExplorer | Checked in code: FinLit Markets.tsx has all seven tabs, date and symbol filters, in-table search, paging and CSV export, and its Commodities tab has both catalogues (monthly indices, eight core industries), search, history and month change. Nothing found missing. Only differences: upstream pages the commodity catalogue (FinLit scrolls it) and is administrator-only (FinLit: Gold). |
| Named shareholders (DetailedShareholding): parity check | DetailedShareholding | FinLit Fundamentals.tsx has the named-shareholder Tree from `shareholdingDetails`. Nothing missing. |
| Contact form "investment size" | Contact | Optional field the site backend accepts (`investment_size`). |
| Published service prices | data/services.js, finlitAssistantData | Rs 99 first session to Rs 2,499 a year. FinLit deliberately withholds prices ("announced soon"); listed only for completeness. |
| "Financial Product - Coming soon" page | FinancialProductPage | Placeholder at `/financial-product`. |
| Bundled portfolio fallback | data/portfolio.js, usePortfolioData | Upstream shows the bundled report when the API is down; FinLit shows an error state. |

### Port risk found while checking (premium model)

* `PremiumFinancialHistory.jsx` reads `report.calculationTrace` (quarterly and annual sales, owner profit, EBITDA, EPS, operating cash flow, book equity, latest ratios). CONTRACT.md removes `calculationTrace` from `PrismReport` and adds only `trends` (revenue, profit, EPS). Unless the research API passes these rows on (for example as `financialHistory`), the port loses that section.

## 1. File ledger

### `(repository root)`

| Upstream path | Status | FinLit location | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.gitconfig` | `not-merged` | - | Git identity of the Emergent agent (`emergent-agent-e1`); repository-local tooling. |
| `.gitignore` | `equivalent-exists` | `.gitignore` | FinLit has its own. Upstream additions since 67aab4f (`/output/`, `/outputs/`, `/tmp/`, `*.sqlite*`, `*.xlsx.inspect.ndjson` for audit workspaces) are not in FinLit's file; only matters if someone runs upstream audit scripts from the repo root. |
| `README.md` | `equivalent-exists` | docs/prism/CONTRACT.md + docs/prism/*.md | Upstream README only links the three model docs, which are in docs/prism/. |
| `design_guidelines.json` | `not-merged` | - | Emergent design brief for the CRA/Tailwind site; FinLit has its own design system (frontend/src/styles, design/). |
| `finedge_output.txt` | `not-merged` | - | Output of a one-off FinEdge API access probe (UTF-16 text, key hidden). Generated artefact. |
| `test_finedge_api.py` | `not-merged` | - | One-off FinEdge endpoint probe script at the repo root (no key inside). FinLit's FinEdge use is covered by site-api tests and backend/finlit provider tests. |
| `test_result.md` | `not-merged` | - | Emergent testing-protocol log. Not product code. |

### `.emergent`

| Upstream path | Status | FinLit location | Note |

| Upstream path | Status | FinLit location | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/webpack.yml` | `equivalent-exists` | .github/workflows/frontend.yml, ci.yml | Upstream builds the CRA app on Node 18/20/22. FinLit CI builds/tests the Vite site (`frontend.yml`) and runs the site backend tests (`ci.yml` job `site-api`). Nothing upstream-only. |

### `assets/team`

| Upstream path | Status | FinLit location | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `assets/team/nishant.png` | `equivalent-exists` | `frontend/public/team/nishant.webp` | Duplicate of frontend/src/assets/team/nishant.png; FinLit ships the same portrait as WebP (About page). |
| `assets/team/umam.png` | `not-merged` | - | Team portrait not referenced by any upstream code (only nishant.png is imported). Personal photo; add only if a team section is wanted. |
| `assets/team/yusra.png` | `not-merged` | - | Team portrait not referenced by any upstream code. Personal photo; add only if a team section is wanted. |

### `backend`

| Upstream path | Status | FinLit location | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `backend/benchmark_resolution.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/benchmark_resolution.py` | Premium model: valuation benchmark (P/E, P/B) resolution for the model. New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. Updated 26 Oct to upstream 6ed9d2a (engine 3.6.10 / ST-LT); still byte-identical (`cmp`). |
| `backend/email_service.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/email_service.py` | Unchanged on both sides since 67aab4f (FinLit copy already identical). |
| `backend/financial_fields.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/financial_fields.py` | Premium model: shared financial field names. New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. |
| `backend/financial_records.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/financial_records.py` | Premium model: provider-neutral numeric/date parsing, row selection and the rupee-to-crore constant (split out of premium_data.py). New upstream since b112ba1, added verbatim. |
| `backend/fundamental_resolution.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/fundamental_resolution.py` | Premium model: source resolution / fallbacks between FinEdge and Upstox. New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. Updated 26 Oct to upstream 6ed9d2a (engine 3.6.10 / ST-LT); still byte-identical (`cmp`). |
| `backend/generate_portfolio_data.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/generate_portfolio_data.py` | Unchanged on both sides since 67aab4f (FinLit copy already identical). |
| `backend/market_data.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/market_data.py` | Unchanged on both sides since 67aab4f (FinLit copy already identical). |
| `backend/portfolio_report.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/portfolio_report.py` | Unchanged on both sides since 67aab4f (FinLit copy already identical). |
| `backend/premium_benchmarks.py` | `merged-3way` | `site-api/backend/premium_benchmarks.py` | Premium model: peer observation collection/cache and reported-first report benchmarks (split out of premium_data.py). New upstream since b112ba1, added verbatim. NOT byte-identical: FinLit differences: an `ObservationCache` (peer observations kept across reports, thread-safe, one lookup shared by concurrent callers), `peer_benchmark` and `resolve_report_benchmarks` take `observations` (and a time budget `PEER_BUDGET_SECONDS`, default 45 s), a `NO_OBSERVATION` marker, and the provider-slot constant is imported from `premium_provider`. Same medians as upstream; fewer provider calls. |
| `backend/premium_classification.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/premium_classification.py` | Premium model: profile extraction and deterministic model-group classification (split out of premium_data.py). New upstream since b112ba1, added verbatim. |
| `backend/premium_completeness.py` | `merged-3way` | `site-api/backend/premium_completeness.py` | Premium model: input completeness and history checks. New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. Updated 26 Oct to upstream 6ed9d2a (engine 3.6.10 / ST-LT); NOT byte-identical any more. FinLit difference: for the BIGGEST_FALL and TRADING_VALUE gaps the note says how many trading sessions the provider returned and how many of the latest 250 / 60 have no valid close / volume (reads the new `risk_calculation` fields). No upstream line is removed. |
| `backend/premium_data.py` | `merged-3way` | `site-api/backend/premium_data.py` | Premium model: model input loader (same loader as Stock Fundamentals). New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. Updated 26 Oct to upstream 6ed9d2a (engine 3.6.10 / ST-LT); NOT byte-identical any more. FinLit differences from the verbatim 6ed9d2a import: (1) the daily-price window skips all-zero rows (a provider pads a holiday or missed feed with an all-zero row; it is not a session), (2) `risk_calculation` also carries `sessions`, `invalidCloseLast250` and `missingVolumeLast60`, used by the completeness note below. |
| `backend/premium_engine.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/premium_engine.py` | Premium model: deterministic scoring engine (3.6.10). New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. Updated 26 Oct to upstream 6ed9d2a (engine 3.6.10 / ST-LT); still byte-identical (`cmp`). |
| `backend/premium_model_config.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/premium_model_config.py` | Premium model: weights, bands and thresholds. New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. Updated 26 Oct to upstream 6ed9d2a (engine 3.6.10 / ST-LT); still byte-identical (`cmp`). |
| `backend/premium_pdf.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/premium_pdf.py` | Premium model: ReportLab PDF renderer. New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. Updated 26 Oct to upstream 6ed9d2a (engine 3.6.10 / ST-LT); still byte-identical (`cmp`). |
| `backend/premium_presentation.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/premium_presentation.py` | Premium model: reader-facing review (pros/cons, notes). New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. Updated 26 Oct to upstream 6ed9d2a (engine 3.6.10 / ST-LT); still byte-identical (`cmp`). |
| `backend/premium_provider.py` | `merged-3way` | `site-api/backend/premium_provider.py` | Premium model: shared bounded provider/retry budget and the standalone FinEdge input loader (split out of premium_data.py). New upstream since b112ba1, added verbatim. NOT byte-identical: FinLit difference: the number of provider calls allowed at once is `PREMIUM_PROVIDER_SLOTS` (1 to 24, default 16) instead of upstream's fixed 2, exported as `PROVIDER_SLOT_COUNT`. |
| `backend/premium_service.py` | `merged-3way` | `site-api/backend/premium_service.py` | Premium model: report generation service (background / inline delivery). New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. Updated 26 Oct to upstream 6ed9d2a (engine 3.6.10 / ST-LT); NOT byte-identical any more. FinLit difference: `generate_report(..., observations=None)` takes peer observations kept by earlier reports and passes them to `resolve_report_benchmarks` (two changed lines: the signature and that call). |
| `backend/premium_snapshot.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/premium_snapshot.py` | Premium model: signed snapshot receipt (HS256, 30 min). New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. |
| `backend/premium_technical.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/premium_technical.py` | ST/LT technical assessment: candle validation, series choice, signal aggregation, ratings/verdict, report contract. New upstream since b112ba1, added verbatim. |
| `backend/premium_technical_sources.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/premium_technical_sources.py` | ST/LT technical assessment: FinEdge index history, Upstox fallback, session-date checks, 15-minute cache. New upstream since b112ba1, added verbatim. |
| `backend/premium_trace.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/premium_trace.py` | Premium model: calculation trace. New upstream since 67aab4f, added verbatim. Updated 26 Oct to upstream 6ed9d2a (engine 3.6.10 / ST-LT); still byte-identical (`cmp`). |
| `backend/pytest.ini` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/pytest.ini` | Unchanged on both sides since 67aab4f (FinLit copy already identical). |
| `backend/requirements.txt` | `merged-3way` | `site-api/backend/requirements.txt` | Upstream adds `reportlab>=4.0,<5`; FinLit keeps its framework upgrades (fastapi 0.143.2, uvicorn 0.54.0, pymongo>=4.11, motor>=3.7, pyjwt, pytest-xdist). 1/1 upstream and 5/5 FinLit lines present. |
| `backend/server.py` | `merged-3way` | `site-api/backend/server.py` | Both sides changed since 67aab4f. Upstream adds the premium-report API (`/api/premium-reports*`, `/api/premium-report-downloads/{token}`, PDF, signed snapshot) and FinEdge/Upstox data recovery; FinLit keeps its hardening (MongoDB copies of uploads and of the portfolio report, `CMS_PASSWORD_LOGIN` gate, plain-password hash fallback, `GEMINI_MODEL`, plain-text chat rules, no "Never quote a price" regression, enquiry list for admins, no `*.vercel.app` CORS). Line proof: 357/357 upstream lines and 75/75 FinLit lines present, 0 deviations (section 2). 26 Oct: merged again, upstream b112ba1..6ed9d2a (+26 lines: technical candles/benchmarks capture, leverage inputs, `ZoneInfo` import); one conflict (the cache store line: FinLit's bounded `_remember_stock_fundamentals` kept, upstream's three `model_inputs` lines added before it). Proof in section 2b. 26 Oct (Dhan candles, FinLit delta, upstream lines unchanged): `PremiumReportRequest` gains optional `suppliedCandles`; `_premium_dashboard_inputs` gains an optional 4th argument `supplied_candles` and its two technical calls (`resolve_technical_prices`, `load_benchmark_history`) are wrapped in `lambda`s passed to `prices_with_supplied` / `benchmarks_with_supplied` (new FinLit file `premium_supplied_candles.py`; with no supplied candles the original calls run with the same arguments); `_generate_premium_report` and the two `generate_report(...)` call sites pass the 4th argument through lambdas. `premium_technical.py` and `premium_technical_sources.py` stay `merged-identical`. New FinLit tests (not upstream): `tests/test_premium_supplied_candles.py`. |
| `backend/stock_dashboard_audit.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/stock_dashboard_audit.py` | Unchanged on both sides since 67aab4f (FinLit copy already identical). |
| `backend/technical_patterns.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/technical_patterns.py` | ST/LT technical assessment: pivots, sweeps, SFPs and range-distributed volume profiles. New upstream since b112ba1, added verbatim. |
| `backend/technical_scoring.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/technical_scoring.py` | ST/LT technical assessment: scoring-only translation of the owner's daily/weekly indicators and ST/LT rules. New upstream since b112ba1, added verbatim. |
| `backend/technical_series.py` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/technical_series.py` | ST/LT technical assessment: EMA/Wilder smoothing, RSI, MACD, ATR/ADX, OBV, regression, percentile rank, beta, benchmark series. New upstream since b112ba1, added verbatim. |
| `backend/vercel.json` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/vercel.json` | Upstream Vercel serverless setting (`maxDuration` 300 s). Inert on FinLit (Render/Docker), kept for parity. |

| `frontend/package-lock.json` | `equivalent-exists` | `frontend/package-lock.json` | Different toolchain (CRA vs Vite); FinLit has its own lock file. |
| `frontend/package.json` | `equivalent-exists` | `frontend/package.json` | Different toolchain (CRA + shadcn + recharts + tiptap + lenis vs Vite + TS). The premium port needs no new package (FinLit draws charts in SVG). |

Every upstream route has a FinLit page except `/financial-product` (a "Coming soon" placeholder) and the admin sub-routes noted below. The two routes added since 67aab4f (`/blog/admin/premium-reports[/:reportId]`) become `/prism` and `/prism/:symbol` (done: routes in App.tsx). |

### `frontend/src/components`

| Upstream path | Status | FinLit location | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `frontend/src/components/CommodityExplorer.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/pages/Markets.tsx (Commodities tab) | Same FinEdge monthly-index / core-infra catalogue and history via `/api/premium/commodities*` (research API proxy). FinLit also has a public commodities page (pages/Commodities.tsx). Nothing upstream-only. |
| `frontend/src/components/CompanyBrowser.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/components/search/SearchOverlay.tsx, pages/Screener.tsx | FinLit finds companies by search/screener. Upstream-only: browsing by FinEdge sector/industry list (uses `/api/stocks/admin/fundamentals/browse` + companyClassifications.json). The research API already proxies it (`GET /api/premium/fundamentals/browse`) but no FinLit page calls it. Its "Select" mode is used by the premium page (done: `Picker` in frontend/src/components/prism/pzr/Landing.tsx). |
| `frontend/src/components/Contact.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/pages/Contact.tsx, pages/Home.tsx (closing call to action) | Contact form posting to `/api/contact`. Upstream-only: the optional "investment size" field (`investment_size`, accepted by the site backend) and the form on the home page itself. |
| `frontend/src/components/DetailedShareholding.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/pages/Fundamentals.tsx (Shareholders tab, "Named shareholders" Tree) | Named shareholder tree from `shareholdingDetails`. |

FinLit shows YoY growth by line on the stock page and QoQ on the latest-quarter section, but not this toggle on the Gold fundamentals dashboard. |
| `frontend/src/components/MarketTicker.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | `frontend/src/components/Tape.tsx` | Index strip; FinLit reads `/api/indices` (research API) instead of the site backend `/api/market-ticker` (still exposed as `getTicker` in lib/siteApi.ts). |
| `frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx, lib/nav.ts | Navigation. |
| `frontend/src/components/Performance.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | `frontend/src/pages/Portfolio.tsx` | Portfolio KPIs and charts. Upstream also shows them as a section of the home page; FinLit shows them on /portfolio only. |
| `frontend/src/components/Philosophy.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/content/site.ts (PHILOSOPHY), pages/About.tsx (principles) | The philosophy chips are in content/site.ts but not rendered on FinLit's home page (FinLit home was redesigned). |
| `frontend/src/components/PremiumFinancialHistory.jsx` | `ported` | frontend/src/components/prism/pzr/History.tsx (`HistoryTables`, charts) fed by `financialHistory` from `reader_view` in backend/finlit/prism.py | Premium report: quarterly/annual results and key ratios from `report.calculationTrace`. NOTE: CONTRACT.md strips `calculationTrace` from `PrismReport` and only adds `trends` (revenue, profit, eps), so the port must carry these rows another way (e.g. a `financialHistory` field) or this section is lost. Changed again upstream in 6ed9d2a (page split into hook + detail component). |
| `frontend/src/components/PremiumInputCompleteness.jsx` | `ported` | frontend/src/components/prism/pzr/Health.tsx | Premium report: missing factors / limited histories from `review.completeness` (premium_completeness.py). |
| `frontend/src/components/PremiumReportDetail.jsx` | `ported` | frontend/src/components/prism/ReportView.tsx | New upstream (6ed9d2a): the completed-report rendering extracted from PremiumReportPage.jsx. |
| `frontend/src/components/PremiumTechnicalAssessment.jsx` | `ported` | frontend/src/components/prism/pzr/Technical.tsx, frontend/src/stock/PrismTechRow.tsx, frontend/src/lib/prismTechnical.ts | New upstream (6ed9d2a): ST/LT score cards, verdict, signals and missing inputs from `technicalAssessment` (see CONTRACT.md, section technicalAssessment; the research API strips weights and hashes; labels are relabelled by the display layer). |
| `frontend/src/components/PremiumTechnicalAssessment.test.jsx` | `ported` | frontend/src/lib/prismTechnical.test.tsx | New upstream (6ed9d2a): test of the technical assessment card. |
| `frontend/src/components/Process.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/content/site.ts (PROCESS) | The 7-step investment process is in content/site.ts but not rendered anywhere in FinLit. |

| `frontend/src/components/FinLitAssistant/AssistantMarkdown.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | site-api/backend/server.py `plain_chat_text`, frontend/src/components/Assistant.tsx | Upstream renders the model's markdown in the bubble; FinLit asks for plain text and strips markdown server-side, so no renderer is needed. |
| `frontend/src/components/FinLitAssistant/AssistantMarkdown.test.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | `site-api/backend/tests/test_chat.py::test_plain_chat_text_strips_markdown` | Test of the markdown renderer; FinLit tests the server-side stripping instead. |

### `frontend/src/data`

| Upstream path | Status | FinLit location | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `frontend/src/data/about.js` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/content/site.ts (FOUNDER, PILLARS, PRINCIPLES) | About page content (FinLit rewrote the wording). |
| `frontend/src/data/companyClassifications.json` | `not-merged` | - | Sector/industry list used only by CompanyBrowser (see "features absent"). |
| `frontend/src/data/portfolio.generated.json` | `merged-identical` | `site-api/backend/portfolio_data/current.json` | Byte-identical (cmp). Upstream bundles it as the offline fallback; FinLit serves it from `/api/portfolio/report`. |
| `frontend/src/data/portfolio.js` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/lib/siteApi.ts (PortfolioReport), content/site.ts (PROCESS, PILLARS) | Static portfolio fallback + home copy. FinLit has no bundled fallback (shows an error state if the site backend is down). |
| `frontend/src/data/services.js` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/content/site.ts (SERVICES, PRICING with PRICE_TBA) | Services. Upstream publishes prices (First Session Rs 99 ... 1 Year Rs 2,499); FinLit deliberately does not. |

### `frontend/src/hooks`

| Upstream path | Status | FinLit location | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `frontend/src/hooks/use-toast.js` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/lib/ui.tsx (toast) | shadcn toast hook; FinLit has its own toast. |
| `frontend/src/hooks/usePortfolioData.js` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/pages/Portfolio.tsx (useQuery getPortfolio) | Portfolio fetch. Upstream merges with the bundled fallback; FinLit does not. |
| `frontend/src/hooks/usePremiumReport.js` | `ported` | frontend/src/lib/prism.ts (`usePrismCalculation`, `useLatestPrism`) | New upstream (6ed9d2a): the report workflow hook extracted from the page (generation, restore, download). |
| `frontend/src/hooks/usePremiumReport.test.jsx` | `ported` | frontend/src/lib/prism.test.ts | New upstream (6ed9d2a): tests of that hook. |

### `frontend/src/lib`

| Upstream path | Status | FinLit location | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `frontend/src/lib/cms.js` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/pages/Admin.tsx (adminFetch), lib/siteApi.ts | CMS token + requests. The change since 67aab4f (`responseType: "blob"` for the premium PDF) is replaced by the research API PDF route (done: `downloadPrismPdf` in frontend/src/lib/prism.ts). |
| `frontend/src/lib/currentPremiumReport.js` | `ported` | frontend/src/lib/prism.ts (`pdfOpen`) | DELIBERATE DEVIATION: not ported as written. Keeps the signed snapshot of the current report in sessionStorage for the PDF. By CONTRACT.md the snapshot stays server-side (Redis `prism:snap:{id}`, 30 min) and the browser only gets `pdfAvailableUntil`; the expiry logic is `pdfOpen(pdfAvailableUntil)` in lib/prism.ts; the signed snapshot is never in the browser. |
| `frontend/src/lib/currentPremiumReport.test.js` | `ported` | frontend/src/lib/prism.test.ts | Tests snapshot expiry / reuse; re-expressed in lib/prism.test.ts against `pdfAvailableUntil` and the 410 "expired" answer. |
| `frontend/src/lib/fundamentalGrowth.js` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/stock/Sections*.tsx (YoY growth by line) | Growth maths for IncomeGrowthView (YoY/QoQ with missing-value reasons). See IncomeGrowthView. |
| `frontend/src/lib/fundamentalGrowth.test.js` | `equivalent-exists` | `frontend/src/lib/qresults.test.ts` | Tests of the growth maths; FinLit tests its own quarter maths. |
| `frontend/src/lib/premiumReportDownload.js` | `ported` | frontend/src/lib/prism.ts (`downloadPrismPdf`) | DELIBERATE DEVIATION: New upstream (6ed9d2a): signed-snapshot PDF download request; FinLit downloads through `/api/prism/reports/{id}/pdf`. |
| `frontend/src/lib/premiumReportDownload.test.js` | `ported` | frontend/src/lib/prism.test.ts | New upstream (6ed9d2a): tests of that download helper. |
| `frontend/src/lib/premiumReportPolling.js` | `ported` | frontend/src/lib/prism.ts (`backoff`, `transient`, background-job polling) / backend/finlit/prism.py | DELIBERATE DEVIATION: Polls `state: generating` with back-off on 408/429/5xx. CONTRACT.md uses inline delivery (the research API waits), so the retry/back-off behaviour moves to the research API call and the page's 429/502/503 handling. |
| `frontend/src/lib/premiumReportPolling.test.js` | `ported` | frontend/src/lib/prism.test.ts | Tests of the polling/back-off; re-expressed in lib/prism.test.ts (`backoff`, `transient`) for the inline and background-job flow. |
| `frontend/src/lib/premiumReportReview.js` | `ported` | frontend/src/lib/prism.ts (`prismReview`) | Builds pros/cons from metrics for older reports without `review`. Server always returns `review` (premium_presentation.build_report_review); keep the fallback for stored rows. |
| `frontend/src/lib/premiumReportReview.test.js` | `ported` | frontend/src/lib/prism.test.ts | Test of the review fallback. |
| `frontend/src/lib/utils.js` | `not-merged` | - | shadcn `cn()` class-name helper (clsx + tailwind-merge). |

| `frontend/src/pages/BlogAdminLoginPage.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/pages/Admin.tsx (AdminLogin), pages/Login.tsx | FinLit: member sign-in with MFA, then CMS token; password-only CMS login is off unless `CMS_PASSWORD_LOGIN=1`. |
| `frontend/src/pages/BlogAdminNewPage.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/pages/Admin.tsx (New article) | PARTIAL: text articles only (see ContentEditor). |
| `frontend/src/pages/BlogAdminPage.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/pages/Admin.tsx, pages/Console.tsx, pages/Premium.tsx | PARTIAL.

| `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | `frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx` | Home. FinLit's redesigned home does not include upstream's Performance, Process, Philosophy and Testimonial sections (content kept in content/site.ts). |
| `frontend/src/pages/MarketsPage.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | `frontend/src/pages/Markets.tsx` | Market Events & Index Dashboard (IPO, results, announcements, transcripts, commodities, indices, index valuation) through `/api/premium/markets/*`; Gold instead of admin-only. |
| `frontend/src/pages/PortfolioPage.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | `frontend/src/pages/Portfolio.tsx` | Realised P&L report. |
| `frontend/src/pages/PremiumReportPage.jsx` | `ported` | frontend/src/pages/Prism.tsx + frontend/src/components/prism/ReportView.tsx (routes /prism, /prism/:symbol) | The premium report page (generate, statement choice, score parts, completeness, data freshness, business performance, pros/cons, review notes, financial history, PDF). Not the same as FinLit's existing `pages/PremiumReport.tsx` (FinLit-score printable report). Changed again upstream in 6ed9d2a (page split into hook + detail component). |
| `frontend/src/components/PremiumReportDetail.test.jsx` | `ported` | frontend/src/pages/Prism.test.tsx | Renamed upstream from `pages/PremiumReportPage.test.jsx` (6ed9d2a): rendering, NOT RATED and PDF tests now target the extracted detail component. |
| `frontend/src/pages/ServicesPage.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/pages/Services.tsx, components/Enquiry.tsx | Services + enquiry to `/api/service-enquiry`. Prices intentionally not shown in FinLit. |
| `frontend/src/pages/StockFundamentalsAdminPage.jsx` | `equivalent-exists` | frontend/src/pages/Fundamentals.tsx (+ stock/StockPage.tsx) | PARTIAL. FinLit's Gold "Stock Fundamental Data Dashboard" has snapshot, P&L, balance sheet, cash flow, ratios, profitability ratios, revenue segments, shareholding (pattern, structure, pledge, named holders), peers and corporate actions via `/api/premium/fundamentals`; price chart, returns, insights and data quality come from the research API on the stock page. Upstream-only: Bank Asset Quality (GNPA, NNPA, CET1), Data Quality Flags (FinEdge vs fallback provider disagreements), Dev Metrics (fetch timing), sector/industry company browser, the P&L "Growth %" YoY/QoQ view (added since 67aab4f), and the Stock DNA / Valuation / Quality / Technicals key-factor panels built from FinEdge highlights. |

## 2. Line-level proof for the three-way merged files

Method: for each file, the non-blank, whitespace-normalised `+`/`-` lines of `git diff 67aab4f HEAD -- backend/<file>` (upstream) and of upstream 67aab4f -> FinLit `1346489^:site-api/backend/<file>` (FinLit-local) were checked against the merged `site-api/backend/<file>`: every added line must be present (as many times as the change requires), no removed line may come back, and for every line the merged count must equal FinLit + upstream - base. Independently, a fresh `git merge-file -p` of (FinLit pre-merge, 67aab4f, upstream HEAD) was compared byte-for-byte with the merged file.

Which files really had both sides changed (all `site-api/backend` files classified base / FinLit / upstream / merged):

* both changed: `server.py`, `requirements.txt` -> merged-3way
* only upstream changed: `tests/conftest.py` -> result equals upstream HEAD (byte-identical)
* only FinLit changed: `tests/test_api.py`, `tests/test_chat.py`, `tests/test_portfolio_report.py`, `tests/test_service_enquiry.py` -> result equals FinLit pre-merge (upstream HEAD content all present)
* every other upstream backend file: unchanged on both sides or new upstream, byte-identical (section 3)
* FinLit-only: `portfolio_data/sources/.gitkeep` (kept); upstream-only: the two broker PDFs (not merged)

Result: **no missing line, nothing to fix.**

```

Semantic check: none of the 357 upstream lines added to `server.py` calls a function FinLit replaced (`read_current_portfolio_report`, `stored_asset_path`, chat/CMS login code); the new routes are all under `require_admin`.

### 2b. Second merge, 26 October: upstream b112ba1..6ed9d2a (48 files: 34 backend, 4 model docs, 10 frontend)

Classification (`site-api/backend/<f>` against upstream `b112ba1:backend/<f>` with `cmp`): of the 34 changed or new upstream backend files, **33 were never modified by FinLit** (21 changed upstream, 12 new) and
were replaced by upstream 6ed9d2a (byte-identical, section 3b); only `server.py` was changed on both sides and went through
`git merge-file` (base = `b112ba1:backend/server.py`, ours = FinLit main, theirs = `6ed9d2a:backend/server.py`). Upstream changed no `requirements.txt` in this range, so none was merged, and no fixture file changed.
The one conflict was resolved keeping both intents: FinLit's `_remember_stock_fundamentals(cache_key, ...)` (bounded cache, replaces upstream's direct
dictionary store) stays, and upstream's three added `model_inputs[...]` lines (`technicalPrices`, `leverage`, `secondaryLeverage`) are placed before it.

Proof (non-blank, whitespace-normalised lines; `M != L+T-B` compares the merged file with the multiset ours + theirs - base):

```
upstream 6ed9d2a vs b112ba1: +26 / -0 non-blank lines
FinLit-local vs b112ba1:     +148 / -18
upstream added lines present in merged: 26/26
FinLit-local added lines present in merged: 148/148
upstream-removed lines still in merged beyond FinLit's own copies: 0
multiset deviations (M != L+T-B): 0
lines only in merged: []  only in expected: []
```

Semantic check: the 26 upstream lines only add the technical-candle and benchmark capture, two model inputs and the `ZoneInfo` import; none calls a function FinLit replaced.
`premium_service.py` and `premium_pdf.py` (the signed snapshot now carries `technicalAssessment`; the PDF renders it without provider calls) are byte-identical to upstream.

## Deliberate deviations (premium files that are NOT byte-identical to upstream 6ed9d2a)

Checked against the verbatim import (commit 6f28e02) with `git diff 6f28e02 HEAD -- site-api/backend/<file>`. The other premium files (premium_engine, premium_model_config, premium_trace, premium_presentation, premium_classification, premium_pdf) have an empty diff and stay byte-identical; premium_pdf.py is deliberately untouched, and the buy/sell-word relabelling happens on a copy of the report in technical_wording.py before it is rendered.

| File | How it differs |
| --- | --- |
| `premium_data.py` | The daily-price window skips all-zero rows (a holiday or missed feed, not a session). `risk_calculation` also carries `sessions`, `invalidCloseLast250` and `missingVolumeLast60`. |
| `premium_completeness.py` | The BIGGEST_FALL and TRADING_VALUE gap notes say how many sessions the provider returned and how many of the latest 250 / 60 have no valid close / volume (6 added lines). |
| `premium_service.py` | `generate_report(..., observations=None)` and the call to `resolve_report_benchmarks` pass peer observations kept by earlier reports (2 changed lines). |
| `premium_benchmarks.py` | `ObservationCache`, `observations` and a time budget (`PEER_BUDGET_SECONDS`, 45 s) in `peer_benchmark` / `resolve_report_benchmarks`, the `NO_OBSERVATION` marker, and the provider-slot import (70 lines added, 9 changed). |
| `premium_provider.py` | Provider calls allowed at once come from `PREMIUM_PROVIDER_SLOTS` (1 to 24, default 16) instead of a fixed 2; `PROVIDER_SLOT_COUNT` is exported. |

## 3. Byte identity

## 4. Tests

Site backend, full suite after the 26 October merge (`cd site-api && PYTHONPATH=.:backend <site-venv>/bin/python -m pytest -q -n 4 -c backend/pytest.ini backend/tests`):

```
499 passed, 1 skipped, 36 warnings
SKIPPED [1] backend/tests/test_portfolio_report.py:11: source statement not present   (the broker PDF that was deliberately not added)
```

Upstream's documented model regression list (docs/prism/premium-model-implementation.md, "Run the relevant regression suites"), run against the FinLit copy: `457 passed`.
(The first merge, at b112ba1, recorded 446 passed, 1 skipped for the whole suite and 408 for this list.) New upstream tests this time: `test_premium_technical.py`,
`test_premium_technical_sources.py`, `test_premium_insurance_leverage.py`; 11 upstream test files were updated for the module split and 3.6.10.

Research API (`backend/tests/test_prism.py`, real Postgres and Redis): 42 passed (5 new tests for `technicalAssessment`, and the two 3.6.9 version asserts became 3.6.10).

The frontend half of that list is tested by the frontend task (vitest); the upstream CRA tests it mirrors are listed in section 1 as `ported`.

## 5. Dependencies in production

Third-party imports of `site-api/backend` (all modules and tests): fastapi, starlette, pydantic, motor, pymongo, bcrypt, jwt (PyJWT), dotenv, requests, pypdf, nh3, resend, google-genai, **reportlab** (new, premium_pdf.py), pytest; `zoneinfo` needs tzdata. All are in `site-api/backend/requirements.txt` (reportlab pulls Pillow and charset-normalizer). Installed in the test venv: reportlab 4.5.1, PyJWT 2.15.1, pypdf 6.21.2, Pillow 13.0.0.

Every production path installs that file, so reportlab reaches production with no deploy change:

* `Dockerfile` (Render single image, render.yaml): `/opt/site-venv/bin/pip install -r site-api/backend/requirements.txt` (Python 3.13), copies all of `site-api/backend`.
* `deploy/site-api/Dockerfile` (docker-compose.prod/staging): `pip install -r requirements.txt` from `site-api/backend` (Python 3.12), `COPY . .`.
* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` job `site-api`: `pip install -r site-api/backend/requirements.txt mongomock-motor` and runs the whole suite (Python 3.12), so the new model tests run in CI.
* `.github/workflows/security.yml`: `pip-audit --strict -r site-api/backend/requirements.txt` now also audits reportlab (and Pillow). pip-audit is not installed here, so this was not run locally.

The research API (`backend/requirements.txt`) needs nothing new for the Prism hop: it already signs the HS256 CMS token without PyJWT (`backend/finlit/auth/routes.py`, `backend/finlit/premium.py`). The new model modules read no new environment variable (the snapshot is signed with the existing `CMS_JWT_SECRET`; data uses the existing `FINEDGE_API_KEY` / `UPSTOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`). The 26 October merge adds no dependency and no variable either (`requirements.txt` unchanged upstream); in practice the ST/LT technical assessment needs `UPSTOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` for complete candles, see `DEPLOY.md`.

Gaps: **none blocking.** Notes for the deploy owner: (a) `deploy/render-start.sh` can start the site backend through `dev/site_api_dev.py`, which imports `mongomock_motor`, but that package is not in `site-api/backend/requirements.txt` (only CI installs it), so that fallback path would fail in the image; this predates the merge. (b) `site-api/backend/vercel.json` is inert outside Vercel. (c) The premium PDF uses ReportLab's built-in fonts only, so no system font package is needed in the slim images.
