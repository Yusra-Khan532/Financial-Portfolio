# Research tools: what each plan gets, and where the data comes from

Written against the "FinLit Technical Improvement & Modernization Plan" (Oct 2026). Plan names are Basic (free), Silver and Gold.

| Tool | Basic | Silver | Gold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Screener** (`/screener`) | **Starter**: 14 core filters (size, returns, P/E, ROE, ROCE, margin, 5Y growth, debt, interest cover, yield), sector, size and index; the first 25 matches | **Full: 160+ filters** in 15 groups (valuation, profitability, growth, quarterly results, financial health, liquidity, solvency, efficiency, ownership, company events, red flags, banks, volume/range/trend), every match, ready-made and saved screens, CSV download, shareable link | + **FinLit model filters**: score, band, five pillars, score movement, strengths/watch-outs counts, Gold screens |
| **Compare** (`/compare`) | 2 companies: Overview, Fundamentals, Spider, Valuation; choose which measures | + model tabs (Quality & Risk, Growth, Technical) and Build your own, pillar radar | up to 4 companies |
| **Watchlist** (`/watchlist`) | preview | up to 3 named lists, 30 stocks, notes, target prices, bucket by industry/size, sector mix, compare selected, CSV | unlimited lists, bucket by FinLit band and style, "worth a second look" signals |
| **Glossary** (`/glossary`) | all 95 terms, A–Z, search, categories, formulas | same | same |
| **Latest quarter** and **Trends** (stock page) | yes | yes | yes |

Plan checks in the browser are a *preview* (the "Preview" switch in the header). Real entitlements must be enforced by the API once accounts and payments ship; the browser never receives data it should not show.

## Data
- **Screener and Compare** read one endpoint, `GET /api/screener/universe`: one row per scored company from the `scores` table (migration `003_screener_columns.sql` adds name, P/B, ROCE, debt/equity, growth, margin and return columns). The browser filters and compares locally, so no request is made per click. About 5,700 rows is roughly 1 MB before compression.
- **Percentiles** ("beats 82% of companies") and the "range most companies fall in" strips are computed in the browser from that same list.
- **Latest quarter / Trends** use the existing `financials` section (`quarterly.pl`, yearly P&L, balance sheet and cash flow), `segments`, `events` and `ratios`. When a new quarter is published, the next ingest run updates them; nothing else changes.
- **Glossary** content is `frontend/src/content/glossary.json`, parsed from the owner's *Finance Glossary A–Z* PDF (95 terms). Categories were assigned by us; the PDF places "Asset Turnover Ratio" under T and "Ex-Dividend Date" under X, and those placements are kept as supplied.
- **Watchlists** are stored in the browser (`localStorage`) until accounts exist; the same shape will sync to the server.

## Demo build
`VITE_DEMO=1` serves saved JSON. Only RELIANCE is a real report. For the screener and comparison the demo adds **fictional** companies (symbols start with `SMP-`) from `frontend/public/demo/screener.json`, clearly flagged on screen. Regenerate with `python backend/scripts/make_demo_universe.py frontend/public/demo`.

## Fonts and security
Fonts are bundled with the site (`@fontsource`), so no request goes to Google Fonts; the Content-Security-Policy no longer allows `fonts.googleapis.com` or `fonts.gstatic.com`.


## The screener (how it works)

- **One list of filters:** `backend/finlit/screener/catalog.py` (169 filters: key, label, group, unit, plan). Everything else reads it: the numbers, the plan check, the website.
- **Numbers:** `screener/compute.py` works every filter out from the stored snapshot sections (no provider calls) and saves it as `scores.metrics` (JSON). A filter that cannot be worked out is left empty and never matches (P/E of a loss-maker is empty, not negative).
- **Answering:** `POST /api/screener/query` filters, sorts and pages in memory (`screener/data.py`, refreshed every 3 minutes); about 1 ms per query. `GET /api/screener/catalog` lists filters with where companies sit; `POST /api/screener/export` is the CSV (Silver+).
- **Plans are enforced on the server:** a locked filter, sort or column is refused (403 `plan_required`), so locked data cannot be read through any route. Basic gets 14 filters and the first 25 matches; Silver everything except the FinLit model group; Gold everything.
- **Index membership** (NIFTY 50, Next 50, 100, 200, 500, Midcap, Smallcap, Bank, IT, FMCG, Pharma, Auto) comes from the free NSE Indices constituent lists: `python -m finlit.worker refresh-indices` (weekly).
- **Existing data:** `python -m finlit.worker rebuild-metrics` recomputes every company from what is already stored (database only, seconds). The scheduler runs it on start (`--only-missing`) for companies loaded before the screener existed or before a newer metric such as `q_period_end` was added.
- **Saved-screen emails** use the same rules and only mail filters the member's plan includes.
- The static demo (`VITE_DEMO=1`) keeps the small client-side screener (`ScreenerLite`); the live site uses `ScreenerPro`.
